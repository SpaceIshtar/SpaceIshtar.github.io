I am Jiarui Luo, an undergraduate student in Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China. I am expected to receive my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology in June 2023 and I am currently pursuing a PhD position to further develop my skills as a CS researcher.

My research interests are **systems and algorithms for large-scale data**. During my undergraduate study, I have had some precious research experience in the following topics:

* Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search
